# minirt_converter_42

### Description
A very useful program to conert .obj into .rt for my project [Mini-RT](https://github.com/UnDesSix/minirt_42)

Thank you [Zodiac](https://github.com/ZodiacFRA) for your help :fire:

***
### How does it work ?
Run the program with the .obj file in first argument and the name of the output you want in second argument.
Depending if you have '/' between you vertices, you can comment and uncomment line 14 et 15.
If you want to create some art, uncomment ligne 42 et comment line 43 (which allow you to chose the color of the object).

Finally, you may want to change axis, depending how you've implemented it in your code.

:warning: Note: x is right axis, y is up axis and z is foward axis. :warning:

Enjoy guys :grinning:
